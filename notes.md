# Development Notes

## Current Goal
Setting up the trading card image segmentation project as a proper git repository and beginning Phase 1 development.

## Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Data Collection
- **Git Repository**: Initialized ✅
- **Project Structure**: Basic files created ✅

## What We Have Tried
1. ✅ Initialized git repository
2. ✅ Created comprehensive .gitignore for Python/ML project
3. ✅ Created README.md with project overview
4. ✅ Created notes.md for tracking progress

## Current Problems
- None identified yet - project is in initial setup phase

## Next Steps
1. Make initial git commit with foundation files
2. Set up basic project directory structure
3. Begin Phase 1 tasks:
   - Docker development environment setup
   - API integrations for data collection
   - Database schema design

## Possible Solutions for Future Issues
- **Data Collection**: Multiple API sources identified (Scryfall, Pokémon TCG API, YGOPRODeck)
- **Model Training**: Ensemble approach with YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, and SAM
- **Performance**: Target 86%+ mAP@0.5 with <200ms inference time

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Detectron2 for instance segmentation
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV 4.x for preprocessing
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes for scalability
- **Monitoring**: MLflow for experiment tracking

## Resources and References
- Development roadmap: `developemnt-roadmap.md`
- Target datasets: Scryfall API, Pokémon TCG API, PSA Baseball Grades Dataset
- Performance benchmarks: 86%+ accuracy, <200ms inference, >1000 cards/hour throughput

## Development Environment
- **OS**: Linux 6.8.0-79-generic
- **Hardware Requirements**: 8GB+ VRAM GPU, 32GB RAM minimum
- **Container**: Docker with CUDA support planned
