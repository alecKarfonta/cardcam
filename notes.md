# Pokemon Card Detection - Current Status

## Current Goal
Fix issues with Training Dataset Manager - COMPLETED

## Problems Identified & FIXED
1. **Bounding boxes not aligned with images in dataset viewer** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Double normalization bug in DatasetManager.createFromVideoFrame()
   - The detections are already normalized (0-1) but code was dividing by videoWidth/videoHeight again
   - Solution: Removed double normalization, detections are now used directly

2. **Image stretched in weird way in editor** - FIXED
   - bbox-editor.js was drawing image stretched to fill canvas
   - Solution: Implemented letterboxing with proper aspect ratio preservation
   - Added imageDrawX, imageDrawY, imageDrawWidth, imageDrawHeight properties
   - Updated coordinate transform functions to account for letterboxing

3. **Storage quota exceeded (localStorage)** - FIXED
   - localStorage limited to ~5-10MB
   - Base64 images are large
   - Solution: Implemented IndexedDB storage system with localStorage fallback
   - IndexedDB supports 50+ MB typical limit
   - Created dataset-storage.js module
   - Updated all DatasetManager methods to be async
   - Added storage type and usage display in UI

## Solutions Implemented
1. Fixed coordinate normalization bug in dataset-manager.js
   - Detections are already normalized (0-1), removed duplicate division
   - Changed to use det.x, det.y, det.width, det.height directly
   
2. Fixed image aspect ratio in bbox-editor.js
   - Added calculateImageBounds() method for letterboxing
   - Updated canvasToNormalized() and normalizedToCanvas() to account for offsets
   - Background fills with black to show letterbox areas
   
3. Implemented IndexedDB storage system
   - Created dataset-storage.js with DatasetStorage class
   - Supports IndexedDB with automatic fallback to localStorage
   - All save/load operations are now async
   - Better error handling and quota management
   - Storage type and size displayed in UI
   
4. Updated all async operations
   - Made addExample(), removeExample(), clearAll(), saveToStorage() async
   - Updated all callers to use await
   - Updated dataset viewer callbacks to handle async properly

## Files Changed
- frontend/public/dataset-manager.js - Fixed normalization, added async storage
- frontend/public/dataset-storage.js - NEW FILE for IndexedDB storage
- frontend/public/bbox-editor.js - Fixed aspect ratio with letterboxing
- frontend/public/dataset-viewer.js - Updated for async operations, added storage stats
- frontend/public/camera_test.html - Added dataset-storage.js script, fixed async calls

## Testing Needed
- Test adding examples to dataset
- Verify bounding boxes align correctly with images in editor
- Verify image aspect ratio is maintained
- Verify storage works (should see "IndexedDB" in stats)
- Test with multiple examples to verify storage capacity

## Possible Next Steps
- Add image compression options to reduce storage further
- Add batch export functionality
- Add import functionality
- Add data augmentation tools
