# Card Extraction Padding Improvements

## Problem
Card extraction needed better padding to capture whole cards, especially near image edges.

## Changes Made

1. **Increased Padding**: Changed from 5% to 10% padding ratio
2. **Improved Rotated Cards**: Added boundary-aware padding for oriented bounding boxes
3. **Enhanced Axis-Aligned Cards**: Better edge handling with intelligent boundary clamping

## Key Improvements
- Intelligent boundary-aware padding
- Always stays within image bounds
- Maximizes padding while respecting constraints
- Better card extraction quality for edge cases

## Benefits
- Better card capture with more context
- Robust edge case handling
- Improved extraction quality
- Boundary safety (never crops outside image)

## Build Status
✅ Frontend container builds successfully
✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
✅ All changes properly typed and integrated
