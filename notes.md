# Development Notes

## Current Goal
Complete Phase 1 infrastructure and begin data collection from trading card APIs.

## Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Data Collection
- **Infrastructure Setup**: Complete ✅
- **API Integrations**: Complete ✅
- **Database Schema**: Complete ✅
- **Docker Environment**: Complete ✅

## What We Have Tried
1. ✅ Initialized git repository with proper structure
2. ✅ Created comprehensive .gitignore for Python/ML project
3. ✅ Created README.md with project overview and technical specs
4. ✅ Set up Docker development environment with GPU support
5. ✅ Designed PostgreSQL database schema for cards and annotations
6. ✅ Implemented API clients for Scryfall, Pokemon TCG, and YGOPRODeck
7. ✅ Created modular project structure with src/ organization
8. ✅ Set up DVC for data versioning
9. ✅ Created configuration files and environment templates

## Current Problems
- None identified - infrastructure setup complete and ready for data collection

## Next Steps
1. Test Docker environment build and GPU access
2. Begin data collection from APIs (target: 50K+ cards)
3. Set up data quality validation pipeline
4. Start initial dataset analysis for Phase 2 planning

## Possible Solutions for Future Issues
- **Data Collection**: Multiple API sources identified (Scryfall, Pokémon TCG API, YGOPRODeck)
- **Model Training**: Ensemble approach with YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, and SAM
- **Performance**: Target 86%+ mAP@0.5 with <200ms inference time

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Detectron2 for instance segmentation
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV 4.x for preprocessing
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes for scalability
- **Monitoring**: MLflow for experiment tracking

## Resources and References
- Development roadmap: `developemnt-roadmap.md`
- Target datasets: Scryfall API, Pokémon TCG API, PSA Baseball Grades Dataset
- Performance benchmarks: 86%+ accuracy, <200ms inference, >1000 cards/hour throughput

## Development Environment
- **OS**: Linux 6.8.0-79-generic
- **Hardware Requirements**: 8GB+ VRAM GPU, 32GB RAM minimum
- **Container**: Docker with CUDA support planned
