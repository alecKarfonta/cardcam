### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

**Component Structure:**
```
CardExtractionView.tsx (main component)
â”œâ”€â”€ CardDetailsView.tsx (enhanced detail view)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DetectionMetadata.tsx (detection info)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RotationControls.tsx (rotation correction)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ModelPlaceholders.tsx (AI model results)
```

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Tabbed interface for different information sections
- Pan and zoom functionality with mouse/touch support
- Real-time rotation preview with canvas manipulation
- Comprehensive metadata display with responsive design
- Mock AI model results with realistic confidence scores
- Navigation between cards in detail view
- Download functionality for processed cards

**State Management:**
- Added view mode state ('grid' | 'details')
- Enhanced card selection handling
- Rotation state management with temp/applied states
- Canvas reference management for multiple views

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: Canvas Reference Management (ONGOING)
**Issue**: Canvas references getting corrupted when switching between grid and detail views
**Root Cause**: Mismatch between canvas rendering logic (uses `extractedCards` index) and reference assignment (uses `filteredCards` mapped to `extractedCards` index)
**Current Solution**: 
- Added `viewMode` dependency to canvas rendering effect
- Added small delay when returning to grid view to ensure refs are properly set
- Re-render canvases when switching back to grid view

### Problem 2: State Synchronization
**Issue**: Selected card index becoming invalid after filtering
**Solution**: Added effect to reset selection and view mode when filtered cards change

### Problem 3: Component Integration
**Issue**: Integrating new detailed view with existing grid view
**Solution**: Used conditional rendering based on view mode, maintaining backward compatibility

### Problem 4: Canvas Re-rendering Issue (ACTIVE DEBUGGING)
**Issue**: Images disappear from grid when returning from detail view
**Analysis**: Canvas references get reassigned but rendering doesn't trigger because `extractedCards` hasn't changed
**Root Cause Discovery**: CardDetailsView has its own independent canvas system, causing grid canvases to lose their rendered content when switching views

**Latest Solution Attempt**:
1. **Immediate rendering in ref callback**: Canvas renders immediately when ref is assigned
2. **Enhanced debugging**: Added console logs to track canvas reference states and rendering success
3. **Multiple rendering attempts**: Using both useEffect and ref callback rendering
4. **Increased delays**: Using requestAnimationFrame + setTimeout for better timing

**Debugging Added**:
- Console logs when switching back to grid view
- Canvas reference status tracking
- Render count verification
- Immediate rendering in canvas ref callback

## What's Next

### ðŸš§ Remaining Tasks

1. **Advanced Cropping Controls** (pending)
   - Interactive crop selection on source image
   - Adjustable crop boundaries with handles
   - Multiple crop presets (tight, loose, custom)
   - Source image context display

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

1. **Real Model Integration**
   - Replace mock data with actual ML model endpoints
   - Implement error handling for model failures
   - Add model loading states and progress indicators

   - Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, focus management)

## Technical Notes

### Canvas Manipulation
- Using HTML5 Canvas API for image rotation and display
- Rotation calculations using trigonometry for proper dimension scaling
- Transform origin management for smooth zoom/pan operations

### State Architecture

## Build Issues & Resolution

### âœ… Build Fixed Successfully
**Issue**: TypeScript compilation failed with ExtractedCard interface mismatch
**Root Cause**: Component defined its own ExtractedCard interface missing required properties (extractedAt, dimensions)
**Solution**: 
- Updated imports to use ExtractedCard from Redux slice
- Added graceful handling for optional properties with fallbacks
- Cleaned up unused imports and variables

**Build Status**: âœ… **SUCCESSFUL** - All TypeScript errors resolved, only pre-existing ESLint warnings remain
**Build Method**: âœ… **DOCKER** - Properly built using `docker compose build frontend` in containerized environment

## Detection Overlay Scaling Fix

### âœ… Scaling Issue Resolved
**Issue**: Detection bounding box overlays were misaligned when window was resized
**Root Cause**: Timing issue between window resize and video element size updates
**Solution**: 
- Added timeout delay (50ms) to resize handler to allow video element to update
- Implemented ResizeObserver for more reliable detection of video element size changes
- Added debug logging to help diagnose scaling issues
- Enhanced resize handling with both window resize events and ResizeObserver

**Components Updated**: `DetectionOverlay.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Detection overlays now properly scale with window resizing

## Mobile UI Fixes

### âœ… Mobile Layout Issues Resolved (September 28, 2025)

**Problems Fixed:**
1. **Capture Button Off-Screen**: Camera controls were too tall on mobile devices, pushing capture button below viewport
2. **Menu Items Overlapping**: Extraction view header items overlapped on smaller screens
3. **Missing Safe Area Support**: UI elements could be cut off by mobile device notches/home indicators

**Solutions Implemented:**

**Camera Interface Improvements:**
- Reduced camera controls height from 120px to 90px (tablet) and 80px (mobile)
- Added safe area padding using `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for camera controls
- Repositioned confidence slider above camera controls to prevent overlap
- Added extra small device breakpoint (480px) for better mobile support
- Smaller button sizes and improved touch targets for mobile

**Extraction View Header Fixes:**
- Implemented responsive layout with flex-wrap and proper ordering
- Added vertical stacking for screens under 600px to prevent overlap
- Removed debug styling that was cluttering the interface
- Added safe area padding for top areas
- Improved button and text sizing for mobile devices

**Global Mobile Support:**
- Added viewport-fit=cover to index.html for full-screen mobile support
- Added safe area insets to main App container
- Implemented proper responsive breakpoints (768px, 600px, 480px)

**Technical Details:**
- Used CSS `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for iOS notch/home indicator support
- Implemented progressive enhancement with mobile-first responsive design
- Added proper flex-shrink and min-width properties to prevent layout collapse
- Used CSS order property for logical element arrangement on small screens

**Components Updated**: `CameraInterface.css`, `CardExtractionView.css`, `CardExtractionView.tsx`, `App.css`, `index.html`
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Mobile UI now properly displays capture button and prevents menu overlap

## Object-Fit Cover Scaling Fix

### âœ… Narrow Window Scaling Issue Resolved
**Issue**: Detection bounding boxes were "squished together" at window widths below ~1300px due to `object-fit: cover` cropping
**Root Cause**: Video element uses `object-fit: cover` which crops the video to fill the container. At narrow widths, the video is cropped horizontally, but detection coordinates were still based on the full native video dimensions.

**Technical Details**:
- **Native Video**: 1920x1080 (aspect ratio 1.78)
- **Wide Window**: 1163x808 (aspect ratio 1.44) - video cropped horizontally
- **Narrow Window**: 791x647 (aspect ratio 1.22) - video heavily cropped horizontally

**Solution**: 
- Calculate visible video area based on `object-fit: cover` behavior
- Transform detection coordinates from native video space to visible canvas space
- Skip drawing detections that are completely outside the visible area
- Account for horizontal/vertical cropping based on aspect ratio differences

**Components Updated**: `DetectionOverlay.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Detection overlays now properly scale at all window sizes, including narrow widths
