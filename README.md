# Trading Card Image Segmentation System

An automated trading card image segmentation system capable of processing single cards, card sheets, binders, and folders using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an end-to-end pipeline that accepts various image inputs containing trading cards and outputs individual card images with **86%+ accuracy** for real-world deployment scenarios.

### Key Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Processes single cards, card sheets, binders, and folders
- **High Accuracy**: Target 86%+ detection accuracy across diverse scenarios
- **Real-time Processing**: <200ms inference time for single card images
- **Production Ready**: Scalable cloud deployment with monitoring and alerting

### Supported Card Types

- Magic: The Gathering
- PokÃ©mon TCG
- Yu-Gi-Oh!
- Sports cards (Baseball, Basketball, etc.)
- Other trading card games

## Technical Stack

- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch with Detectron2
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV 4.x
- **Models**: YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI
- **Monitoring**: MLflow, Grafana, Ray Tune

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Collection (Weeks 1-4)
- Technical infrastructure setup
- Data collection from APIs (Scryfall, PokÃ©mon TCG, etc.)
- Initial dataset analysis

### Phase 2: Data Preparation & Annotation (Weeks 5-8)
- CVAT annotation platform setup
- 10,000+ manually annotated images
- Semi-automated annotation pipeline

### Phase 3: Model Development & Training (Weeks 9-16)
- YOLOv11 + Mask R-CNN ensemble
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Performance validation (>86% mAP@0.5)

### Phase 4: Pipeline Integration & System Testing (Weeks 17-20)
- End-to-end pipeline integration
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing framework

### Phase 5: Production Deployment & Monitoring (Weeks 21-24)
- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Continuous improvement pipeline

## Performance Targets

- **Overall Detection**: >86% mAP@0.5 across all scenarios
- **Single Cards**: >95% detection accuracy
- **Multi-card Scenes**: >80% detection accuracy per card
- **Processing Speed**: <200ms for single cards, <1s for multi-card scenes
- **Throughput**: >1000 cards/hour in production

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- 32GB RAM minimum

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd pokemon

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (when available)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Docker environment
docker-compose up -d
```

### Quick Start

```python
from card_segmentation import CardSegmentationPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = CardSegmentationPipeline()

# Process an image
results = pipeline.process_image("path/to/card_image.jpg")

# Extract individual cards
individual_cards = results.individual_cards
print(f"Found {len(individual_cards)} cards")
```
