# Card Details Enhancement Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for enhancing the card details page in the trading card scanner application. The current implementation shows basic card information but lacks robust functionality for detailed analysis, correction, and future ML model integration.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Functionality

### Current Limitations
- Detail view shows minimal information
- No rotation correction capabilities
- Limited cropping options
- No source image context
- Missing placeholders for future ML models
- No comprehensive detection metadata display

## Enhancement Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Robust Detection Information Display** - Show comprehensive metadata about each detection
2. **Rotation Correction** - Allow users to manually correct card rotation
3. **Advanced Cropping** - Enable cropping more of the source image around detected cards
4. **Future ML Model Integration** - Create placeholders for upcoming models
5. **Enhanced User Experience** - Improve usability and visual design

### Secondary Objectives
